[[freshwater-dwc-extension]]
=== Freshwater DwC extension

While we have recommended that occurrence and sampling-event data be amended with other specific <<DwC>> fields when publishing freshwater data (see <<freshwater-amendments,§2.2>> and <<table-07,Table 7>>), several of the fields that should be included in the (meta)data as best practices do not currently have appropriate equivalents in DwC. We recommend the creation of a freshwater DwC extension to allow entry and grouping of <<freshwater-dwc-extension-terms,these fields>> with freshwater data. Prior to the creation of such an extension, we recommend entering all details in the term:dwc[dynamicProperties] field, recognizing that this field is not searchable, and the greatest functionality will result from an extension.

The proposed DwC extension includes the classification of the type of observation (opportunistic, targeted, or assemblage sampling; see <<freshwater-categories,§1.2.2>>) and type of contribution (professional, community-based research, or citizen science data; <<table-08,Table 8>>). In addition, the location of the observation is further described by the <<biome>>, <<ecosystem functional group>>, and freshwater <<lake zone>> or <<river mesohabitat>> (conditional on the biome). 

To allow data to be selected more efficiently for freshwater meta-analyses, the freshwater DwC extension also includes fields for the <<organism group>> and the season of sampling, as well as specifications for the sampling methods.

[[freshwater-data-tagging]]
=== Freshwater data tagging

Data portals such as GBIF.org offer a great variety of data but still show limitations in terms of freshwater species. This relates mostly to the fact that freshwater species and freshwater datasets are not specifically tagged and therefore hard to find among millions of terrestrial and marine species and occurrence records. Looking for entire freshwater datasets (e.g. recordings of whole assemblages) often requires searching for specific freshwater species, which is a time-consuming task.

Freshwater datasets that published through a GBIF node or uploaded using <<IPT>> software should therefore be tagged as “freshwater” to make the dataset more visible to the freshwater community. This can be done by allocating the specific dataset to the “https://www.gbif.org/network/d1627240-04ab-4162-aee9-b16df6bc8308[Freshwater Network^]” during the publication process, after registering it with GBIF.

[[importance-of-reliable-taxonomy]]
=== Importance of reliable taxonomy 

The use of organismal names is ubiquitous in a wide range of research, environmental management and policy domains. Expert-curated taxonomic databases and tools to query these data are therefore essential for ensuring the quality of biological data. Species information systems for monitoring status and trends of biodiversity (e.g. GBIF) and those dealing with policy concerns (e.g. European Water Framework Directive, Natura 2000 species, commercial, invasive alien species and pest species) benefit from such high-quality tools and databases ensuring the interoperability of data. The last global taxonomic assessment of freshwater species dates back to the year 2008 (https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-8259-7[Balian et al. 2008^]). This http://fada.biodiversity.be/[Freshwater Animal Diversity Assessment^] (FADA) comprises a global, extensive set of taxa lists for freshwater animal groups (125,530 described species and 11,388 genera). However, these lists were never fully integrated into GBIF. As taxonomy is a living scientific discipline where new taxa are being described and existing taxa are being placed in new taxonomic positions, the FADA database is https://www.naturalsciences.be/en/science/research/biodiversity-in-a-changing-world/projects/infrafada[currently being updated^] with the ultimate goal to serve as up-to-date freshwater animal taxonomic backbone for GBIF as well as for other international infrastructures like the https://www.catalogueoflife.org[Catalogue of Life^] or the data portal of the http://www.freshwaterplatform.eu[Freshwater Information Platform^] (<<FIP>>), which is currently rebuilt as “FIPbio”.

[[interaction-and-linkages-between-infrastructures]]
=== Interaction and linkages between data infrastructures

Species observed in freshwaters are typically good indicators of the health and status of these ecosystems and are therefore frequently analyzed as part of ecological monitoring programs. The biodiversity data generated during such monitoring routines, in combination with data from other ecological studies in freshwaters, can form an invaluable source of information to support sustainable management and conservation of aquatic ecosystems. However, a large amount of data still remains scattered on individual researchers’ computers and institute servers as well as in different data infrastructures depending on the type of data. This has led to a variety of calls for intense freshwater data mobilization activities as well as a better and more connected infrastructure landscape where data publishing follows the FAIR Principles (e.g. https://doi.org/10.1111/conl.12771[Van Rees et al 2021^]; https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.13931[Maasri et al. 2022^]).

While findability through web search seems to be less of a pressing issue, accessibility of data, interoperability between data infrastructures and reusability still play a major role. This guide seeks to streamline data publication in terms of data reuse and accessibility by making them available through GBIF and by including a specific set of fields for freshwater-relevant information. Alternatively, other publishing platforms that guarantee exchange with GBIF like the data portal of the Freshwater Information Platform (FIPbio) or the South African https://freshwaterbiodiversity.org/[Freshwater Biodiversity Information System^], which both focus on freshwater data, can be used. In any case, we advise that priority be given to infrastructures that provide biogeographic information and are well-connected with GBIF, rather than using simple repositories for data publishing.

Once freshwater data can be more easily filtered within GBIF (through respective tagging of freshwater species), it will be possible to more easily assess global freshwater taxa coverage and to actually identify data and/or research gaps in freshwater biodiversity.
