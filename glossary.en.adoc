[glossary]
[[assemblage]]assemblage:: A collection of biologically- and ecologically-related taxa within a community (i.e. all individuals in an organism group), following the definition of http://www.jstor.org/stable/2463205[Fauth et al. 1996^].
[[benthic]]benthic:: Organisms that live on the bottom (on or in the substrate) of a body of water or wetland.
[[biome]]biome:: According to the https://global-ecosystems.org/page/typology[IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology^] there are three biomes in freshwater: 1) rivers and streams; 2) lakes; and 3) artificial wetlands. Groundwater, brackish water, palustrine wetlands, and coastal systems are grouped within transitional realms.
[[DwC]]DwC:: https://dwc.tdwg.org/[Darwin Core^] data exchange standard
[[ecosystem-functional-group]]ecosystem functional group:: According to the https://global-ecosystems.org/page/typology[IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology^], ecosystem functional groups describe ecological conditions within the realms e.g., permanent, seasonal or episodic/ephemeral; freeze-thaw; upland or lowland; large or small; etc. 
[[FIP]]FIP:: http://www.freshwaterplatform.eu/[Freshwater Information Platform^]
[[IPT]]IPT:: https://www.gbif.org/ipt[Integrated Publishing Toolkit^], localized repository software for publishing biodiversity data to GBIF
[[lake-zone]]lake zone:: Lake habitat zones defined based on depth and characteristics related to light penetration, oxygen levels, substrates and temperature; includes littoral, sub-littoral, profundal, and pelagic
[[microhabitat]]microhabitat:: Fine-scale habitat differences within a water body, such as areas with different substrate composition.
[[organism-group]]organism group:: Collections of biologically- and ecologically-similar organisms that are generally grouped together and described as an assemblage, e.g. benthic invertebrates.
[[realm]]realm:: According to the https://global-ecosystems.org/page/typology[IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology^], there are five realms: 1) terrestrial; 2) freshwater; 3) marine; 4) subterranean; and 5) atmospheric components of the biosphere, as well as transitional zones between realms.
[[river-mesohabitat]]river mesohabitat:: Zones in a river differentiated based on types of flow, including riffles (fast-flowing, shallow, rocky areas), runs (deeper, fast-flowing areas), and pools (areas of slow-flowing or standing water).
